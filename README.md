# ECIR-PSS-ReproducibilityResources

This repository contais the code in the links the resources need to run the code used in this paper. The repository is
divided 3 main parts, corresponding to the three research questions in the paper.

1. EXPERIMENT_1
2. EXPERIMENT_2
3. EXPERIMENT_3

The repository is structured in the following way:

root/
  model_code/
  experiment_notebooks/
  training_scripts/
  raw_predictions/
  dataset/
  trained_models/
  
Because of the size of the dataset and the number of trained models, these are made available through separate links.

## Dataset
The dataset is made available through 3 seperate Zenodo links because of the size of the dataset and the need to keep it anonymous for the double blind review. 

## Trained Models
 - 
 - The models and data can be downloaded manually, but can also be downloaded using the scripts in 'dataset' and 'trained_models'
