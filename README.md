# ECIR-PSS-ReproducibilityResources

This repository contais the code in the links the resources need to run the code used in this paper. The repository is
divided 3 main parts, corresponding to the three research questions in the paper.

1. EXPERIMENT_1
2. EXPERIMENT_2
   - Because the models from EXPERIMENT_1 can take a significant time to evaluate when no GPU is available, we calculate the results here using the saved prediction dictionaries from experiment 1. However, we the predictions can also be obtained by following the guidelines for obtaining the predictions of the models, provided in the EXPERIMENT_1 folder.
4. EXPERIMENT_3
  
Because of the size of the dataset and the number of trained models, these are made available through separate links.

## Dataset
The dataset is made available through 3 seperate Zenodo links because of the size of the dataset and the need to keep it anonymous for the double blind review. 

## Trained Models
 - 
 - The models and data can be downloaded manually, but can also be downloaded using the scripts in 'dataset' and 'trained_models'
