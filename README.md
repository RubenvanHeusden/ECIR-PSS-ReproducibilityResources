# ECIR-PSS-ReproducibilityResources

This repository contais the code in the links the resources need to run the code used in this paper. The repository is
divided into the following parts:

1. Implementations of the Image, Text and combined models from Wiedemann et al.
2. Implementation of the EfficientNet model from Braz
3. Implementation of the BERT model from Guha.
4. Link to the data needed to reproduce the experiments.

The repository is structured in the following way:

root/
  model_code/
  experiment_notebooks/
  training_scripts/
  raw_predictions/
  dataset/
  trained_models/
  
Because of the size of the dataset and the number of trained models, these are made available through separate links.

## Dataset
The dataset is made available through 3 seperate Zenodo links because of the size of the dataset and the need to keep it anonymous for the double blind review. 

## Trained Models
 - 
 - The models and data can be downloaded manually, but can also be downloaded using the scripts in 'dataset' and 'trained_models'
